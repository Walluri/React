1. refs helps you access DOM nodes and react Elements created in render methods.

2. Create Refs using React.createRef and attach it to an ELEMENT using ref attribute.

3. Ref when used on a HTML element and refs when used on a React Class Component are explained.

4. Use 'ref Forwarding' if you need to access a childs DOM node from a parent component.

5. If you need more flexibility than ref forwarding use this alternative approach -> https://gist.github.com/gaearon/1a018a023347fe1c2476073330cc5509

6. When possible dont expose DOM nodes...!
